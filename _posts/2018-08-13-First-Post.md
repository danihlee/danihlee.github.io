"When you wake up in the morning where the Rhododendrons grow..."



As our four hour-long trek to the campsite came to a close, the cries of frantic teenagers could be heard as we ascended up the Allegheny Mountains.  

Lesson 1: Ping Pong

Lesson 2: Sunbutter- Lottery

Lesson 3: Dalai Lama Desmond Tutu- Joy-takers and Joy

While I won't wake up where the rhododendrons grow, I'll be holding onto the insightful ideas, values, and friendships gained from my time in the West Virginia woods.
